## Database

Data for our orders will be compiled in a PostgreSQL database, under the table name "order" located in models/models.py. Features and accepted entries are as follows:

id (Integer)
customer_id (Integer)
order_status (String)
order_created (Datetime)
order_updated (Datetime)
orderitems (Unbounded)


## Functionalities

The following functionalities detail actions users can take when interacting with the orders microservice portion of the website. Functionalities can be found under models/routes.py, and corresponding tests can be found under tests/test_routes.py.

REST API Endpoints:

get_orderitem (Return an Order Item based on its id)
create_order (Create an order)
create_orderitem (Create an item within an order)
get_orders (Return an order based on its id)
list_orders (Return a list of all orders)
delete_orderitem (Delete an item from an order)
delete_order (Delete an order)
update_orders (Update an order)
update_items (Update an item in an order)
list_orderitems (Return a list of all items in a given order)

Utility Functions:

check_content_type (Checks that the media type is correct)

## UI Features

The web interface provides the following features:

1. **Search for Orders**: Search for orders by ID, customer ID, status, or creation date.
2. **View Order History**: View all orders for a specific customer.
3. **Create, Update, and Delete Orders**: Manage orders through a simple form interface.
4. **Update Order Item Quantities**: Modify the quantity of items within an order using:
   - A numeric input field for direct entry
   - Plus/minus buttons for incremental changes
   - Validation to prevent negative or invalid quantities
   - Real-time UI updates after successful quantity changes
   - Error messages for failed updates
