        | 1                | PENDING      | 2023-10-01    | 2023-10-02     |
        | 2                | SHIPPED      | 2023-10-03    | 2023-10-04     |
        | 3                | DELIVERED    | 2023-10-05    | 2023-10-06     |
        | 4                | CANCELED     | 2023-10-07    | 2023-10-08     |
    And the following order items
        | order_id | product_id | quantity | price  |
        | 1        | 101        | 2        | 19.99  |
        | 1        | 102        | 1        | 29.99  |
        | 2        | 103        | 3        | 9.99   |
