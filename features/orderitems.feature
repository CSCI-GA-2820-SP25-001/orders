    As a Customer
    I need to be able to view items in my orders

        | 1           | PENDING      | 2023-10-01    | 2023-10-02    |
        | 2           | SHIPPED      | 2023-10-03    | 2023-10-04    |
        | 3           | DELIVERED    | 2023-10-05    | 2023-10-06    |
        | 4           | CANCELED     | 2023-10-07    | 2023-10-08    |
    And the following order items
        | order_id | product_id | quantity | price  |
